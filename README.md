Participated in Skin condition classification, hackathon by L'Oreal.

In this exciting data science mission, participants are challenged to develop a sustainable and 
efficient machine learning model capable of classifying skin conditions based on beauty product 
descriptions.

The provided dataset was labelled in advance using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
You are required to use this labelled dataset to train one or more machine learning models for the 
classification task. Considering the importance of sustainability and efficiency, participants are 
encouraged to design the smallest possible model that can be deployed in production environments 
without compromising performance
